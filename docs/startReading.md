## Intended Use & Warranty

The ftSwarm project to build small networked controllers for DIY and toy applications. 
This project gives you the needed hard- and software. But it's your project and you need to take care of your project.

- Hobbyist projects need to be supervised all time.
- Don't build robotics, which could harm humans, pets or anything else.
- This project is not intended to build professional robotics.
- You need to test the provided hard- and software on your own, to assure the needed functionality and stability of your hobbyist project.

**Our hard- and software is engineered as a hobbyist project. So it has builtin errors and limitations.
Therefore we exclude any warranty on the hardware and software presented here.**
