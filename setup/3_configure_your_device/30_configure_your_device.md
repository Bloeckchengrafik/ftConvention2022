## Configure Your Device

The ftSwarm is delivered with a pre-installed firmware. This will now report to your terminal program:

```
ftSwarmOS 0.10

(C) Christian Bergschneider & Stefan Fuss

Main menu

(1) wifi settings
(2) swarm settings
(3) local controller
(4) reset to factory settings

(0) exit
main>
```

You now need to configure the `wifi settings` of all controller's and build the swarm in `swarm settings`.
