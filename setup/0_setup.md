## Setup

Before you can write your first Swarm application, you need to do some configuration work. For security reasons, all of the configuration work is done via an usb/serial connection and a terminal program.

You need to go through the following steps:

- Create a usb/serial connection to your computer
- Choose a terminal progam
- Setup wifi connection
- Buid up your swarm.
