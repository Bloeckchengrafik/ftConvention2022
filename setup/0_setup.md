## Setup

Before you can write your first Swarm application, you need to do some configuration work:

- [Create a serial connection via USB](../1_serial)
- [Connect to the ftSwarm console using a terminal program](../2_terminal)
- [Setting up wifi and create a swarm](../3_configure_your_device/30_configure_your_device)
- [Setting up your Arduino IDE](../4_arduino)
