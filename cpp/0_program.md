## Writing C++ Applications

To write C++ applications, you could use the [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) IDE or the [plattformIO](https://platformio.org) platform.
If you are undecided, use the [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) IDE.

At the next pages, we explain the programming basics using some example code. This code is shown and explained in the page's text.
You don't need to cut it out of the text. During the install procedures of the ftSwarm framework, the examples are deployed to your computer, too.

Let's install your environment and start some coding.
