## Welcome to the ftSwarm Project

The goal of the ftSwarm project is to build small networked controllers for DIY and toy applications. Since they are networked with each other, they can act like a swarm. For example, they can act as several independent robots to solve a task together. In larger models, the controllers can be installed at different positions close to actuators and sensors and together control the complete model.

Originally, the project was designed to use with * fischertechnik *. Since the mounting grooves are compatible with Makerbeam profiles, ftSwarms can be used in many DIY projects.
